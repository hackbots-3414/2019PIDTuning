Good consistency with fgain from above:
Encoder Position at 2 seconds	15701 
Warning  0  [phoenix] Initialization is complete.   
 Encoder Position at 4 seconds	15884 
 Default disabled() method running, consider providing your own 
 Auto selected: Default 
 Encoder Position at 2 seconds	15754 
 Encoder Position at 4 seconds	15755 

 So, target was 8000, we ended about double that.  Next is to tune kP, and probably want to do this front and back under load.

 Note that the 15000 values above were still within the tracks (we didn't throw a leg).  Recommend keeping target ~8000 until 
 properly tuned.
